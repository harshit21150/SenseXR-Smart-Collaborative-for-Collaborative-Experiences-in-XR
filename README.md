# Real-time Body Posture Visualization Project

 - This project aims to provide real-time visualization of human body posture using a combination of computer vision (CV) techniques and algorithms applied to multi-modal RGBD data. 
 - The system identifies humans by estimating their pose and 3D location through RGB and Depth cameras. 
 - The project also involves importing the model into a remote virtual environment (server).
